Connecting to Ethereum Using Web3.js Web3.js is a JavaScript library that allows developers to interact with Ethereum smart contracts. Once connected, users can call functions, send transactions, and retrieve data from a smart contract.

Basic Steps:

Set up Web3.js: Install Web3.js using npm install web3.
Connect to the Ethereum Network: Use Infura, Alchemy, or a local node.
Interact with the Contract: Define the contractâ€™s ABI and address, then call functions using web3.eth.Contract.
