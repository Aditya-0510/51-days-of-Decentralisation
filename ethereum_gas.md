What is Ethereum Gas? Gas is a unit that measures the computational work required to execute transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Every operation in a smart contract consumes gas, which users pay for in Ether. Efficient gas usage is critical because the higher the gas, the more expensive the transaction.

Optimization Techniques in Solidity

Minimize Storage Operations: Reading and writing to blockchain storage is costly. Minimize state variable usage and favor memory variables where possible.
Use calldata over memory for External Functions: Parameters in external functions can be stored in calldata to save gas.
Short-circuit Boolean Expressions: Use && and || operators to stop evaluations as soon as the outcome is known.
Batch Operations: Whenever possible, batch multiple operations together to reduce repetitive costs.
