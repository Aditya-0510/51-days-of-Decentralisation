What is Decentralized Identity (DID)? Decentralized Identity (DID) is a concept that allows users to manage their own digital identity through a decentralized, blockchain-based system rather than depending on central authorities like governments, social media platforms, or corporations.

Key Components of DID:

DID Document: Contains the public key and other metadata related to a userâ€™s identity.
Decentralized Identifier: A unique string used to identify the user on the blockchain.
Verifiable Credentials: Digital certificates or proofs, like a driver's license or university degree, that verify specific attributes about the DID holder.
Benefits of DID:

User Control: Users have full control over their identity data.
Privacy: Sensitive information is cryptographically protected, minimizing data exposure.
Portability: Users can use the same DID across multiple platforms or applications.
